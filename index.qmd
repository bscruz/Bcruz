::: {#hero-heading}
As a senior with experience in computational data, I have a solid foundation in data analysis from courses such as BIT150 and EVE 103 which introduced me to computational methods for analyzing genome-wide nucleotide sequences. Additionally, I am currently in a program called Hack the Hood based in Oakland, that delivers data science knowledge to inexperienced and disadvantaged groups. Through this experience, I have learned how computational courses are structured and taught, grounding my technical learning in current social justice topics. This work has empowered me to bring my knowledge back to the community.
