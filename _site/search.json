I’m certified as an RStudio Tidyverse Instructor and am passionate about R education and data literacy as ways to build power in communities. Keep up with my R tinkering in my blog and presentations in talks.\n\n\nTidyverse Instructor Certification ∙ RStudio, PBC ∙ 2020\n\n\n\n\nPrior to joining the Urban Health Lab, I developed novel data mining methods to extract meaningful information from the EHR and study health outcomes and disparities in pregnant populations. I’m particularly interested in research that combines biomedical data science with open data sources in ways that prioritize health equity in communities.\n\n\nCertificate in Biomedical Informatics ∙ University of Pennsylvania ∙ 2019\n\n\nPh.D. in Biomedical Engineering ∙ Purdue University ∙ 2018\n\n\nB.S. in Biomedical Engineering ∙ University of Minnesota ∙ 2012"
