    "text": "For my project, I decided to explore healthcare insurance data sets because I’m interested in understanding how medical conditions influence healthcare costs.\n\n\nThe pie chart below shows that diabetes was one of the most billed conditions at 16.8% of the total billing amount. A total amount billed of 2.385397e+08.\nAdditionally, the person with the highest bill was Karen Kline. She was billed a total 104746.064748 by United Healthcare in the span of 14 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nkARen klInE    104746.064748\nName: Billing Amount, dtype: float64\n\n\nI decided to understand how diabetes was being treated and how it would affect the cost. The table below shows that the number one insurance provider for people with Diabetes was Medicare with 1730 patients total. Additionally Medicare had the highest amount billed which could be due to the the fact that they had more patients.\n\n\nShow the code\ndiabetes = df[df['Medical Condition'] == 'Diabetes']\ndf_unique = diabetes.drop_duplicates(subset='Name', keep='first')\ninsurance = df_unique['Insurance Provider'].value_counts()\nprint(insurance)\n\ncostly = df.groupby(df_unique['Insurance Provider'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)\n\n\nInsurance Provider\nMedicare            1730\nBlue Cross          1683\nCigna               1679\nAetna               1668\nUnitedHealthcare    1624\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n\nLipitor was the drug most likely prescribed to someone with diabetes. A reason for this is that people with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke compared to people without diabetes. Medications such as Lipitor are effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering the chances of a stroke.\n\n\nShow the code\nmedication = diabetes['Medication'].value_counts()\nplt.figure(figsize=(1, 1))\nplt.bar(medication.index, medication.values)\nplt.xlabel('Medication')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Frequency of Medications')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90) \nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncostmed = df.groupby(diabetes['Medication'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)\n\nnewdf = diabetes[['Medication', 'Insurance Provider', 'Billing Amount']]\n\nmedication_billing = newdf.groupby(['Insurance Provider', 'Medication'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(8).reset_index()\nprint(medication_billing)\n\n\n  Insurance Provider   Medication  Billing Amount\n0           Medicare      Aspirin    1.076458e+07\n1              Cigna      Lipitor    1.039165e+07\n2              Aetna  Paracetamol    1.014584e+07\n3              Aetna   Penicillin    9.897654e+06\n4              Cigna   Penicillin    9.862867e+06\n5         Blue Cross    Ibuprofen    9.843164e+06\n6         Blue Cross      Lipitor    9.768164e+06\n7           Medicare  Paracetamol    9.748423e+06\n\n\nLiptor had second largest billed amount for medication under the insurance Cigna. In spite of Cigna having the third largest number of patients it was gaining the most amount of money by providing the Lipitor medication.

Additionally, I am currently in a program called Hack the Hood based in Oakland, that delivers data science knowledge to inexperienced and disadvantaged groups. Through this experience, has empowered me to bring my knowledge back to the community.\nAbout Me! →"
