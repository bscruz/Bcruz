# Healthcare Insurance Data set

For my project, I decided to explore healthcare insurance data sets because I'm interested in understanding how medical conditions influence healthcare costs.


```{python}
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
url = 'healthcare_dataset.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)


```

## What condition was billed the most?

The pie chart below shows that **diabetes** was one of the most billed conditions at 16.8% of the total billing amount. A total amount billed of 2.385397e+08.

```{python}
#| echo: false
billing_by_condition = df.groupby('Medical Condition')['Billing Amount'].sum().reset_index()
billing_by_condition = billing_by_condition.sort_values(by='Billing Amount', ascending=False)
caption = ("hello")
```

[Additionally, the person with the highest bill was **Karen Kline**. <br>She was billed a total 104746.064748 by United Healthcare in the span of **14** days]{.aside}

```{python}
#| echo: false
plt.pie(billing_by_condition['Billing Amount'], labels=billing_by_condition['Medical Condition'], autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Total Billing Amount per Medical Condition')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| echo: false

Karen = df[df['Name']== 'kARen klInE']
mostcost = df.groupby('Name')['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1)
leastcost = df.groupby('Name')['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=True).head(1)
print(mostcost)

```

I decided to understand how diabetes was being treated and how it would affect the cost. The table below shows that the number one insurance provider for people with Diabetes was Medicare with 1730 patients total. Additionally Medicare had the highest amount billed which could be due to the the fact that they had more patients.

```{python}
diabetes = df[df['Medical Condition'] == 'Diabetes']
df_unique = diabetes.drop_duplicates(subset='Name', keep='first')
insurance = df_unique['Insurance Provider'].value_counts()
print(insurance)

costly = df.groupby(df_unique['Insurance Provider'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

```

## Diabetes in the healthcare database

Lipitor was the drug most likely prescribed to someone with diabetes. A reason for this is that people with diabetes are twice as likely to have **heart disease** or a stroke compared to people without diabetes. Medications such as Lipitor are effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering the chances of a stroke. 

```{python}
#| column: margin
medication = diabetes['Medication'].value_counts()
plt.figure(figsize=(1, 1))
plt.bar(medication.index, medication.values)
plt.xlabel('Medication')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Frequency of Medications')
plt.xticks(rotation=90) 
plt.show()

```


```{python}
costmed = df.groupby(diabetes['Medication'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)

newdf = diabetes[['Medication', 'Insurance Provider', 'Billing Amount']]

medication_billing = newdf.groupby(['Insurance Provider', 'Medication'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(8).reset_index()
print(medication_billing)

```
Liptor had second largest billed amount for medication under the insurance Cigna. In spite of Cigna having the third largest number of patients it was gaining the most amount of money by providing the Lipitor medication. Cigna was providing Lipitor medication at a higher amount than other insrance providers. 

```{python}
cigna = diabetes[diabetes['Insurance Provider'] == 'Cigna']
med_admission = cigna.groupby('Medical Condition')['Admission Type'].value_counts()
plt.pie(med_admission, labels=med_admission.index, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Admission Types by Medical Condition')
plt.show()
```
