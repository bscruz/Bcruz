For my project, I decided to explore healthcare insurance data sets because I'm interested in understanding how medical conditions influence healthcare costs.

# Healthcare Insurance Data set

```{python}
#| echo: true

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
url = 'healthcare_dataset.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df.head(5)
```

## What condition was billed the most?

The pie chart below shows that **diabetes** was one of the most billed conditions at 16.8% of the total billing amount. A total amount billed of 2.385397e+08.

```{python}
billing_by_condition = df.groupby('Medical Condition')['Billing Amount'].sum().reset_index()

billing_by_condition = billing_by_condition.sort_values(by='Billing Amount', ascending=False)



plt.pie(billing_by_condition['Billing Amount'], labels=billing_by_condition['Medical Condition'], autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Total Billing Amount per Medical Condition')
plt.show()
```

Additionally, the person with the highest bill was **Karen Kline.** She was billed a total 104746.064748 by United Healthcare in the span of 14 days for cancer treatment.

```{python}
Karen = df[df['Name']== 'kARen klInE']
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
mostcost = df.groupby('Name')['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1)
leastcost = df.groupby('Name')['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=True).head(1)
print(mostcost)

```

I decided to understand how diabetes was being treated and how it would affect the cost. This shows that the number one insurance provider for people with Diabetes was Medicare with 1730 patients total. Additionally Medicare had the highest amount billed which could be to to the the fact that they had more patients.

```{python}
diabetes = df[df['Medical Condition'] == 'Diabetes']
df_unique = diabetes.drop_duplicates(subset='Name', keep='first')
insurance = df_unique['Insurance Provider'].value_counts()
print(insurance)

costly = df.groupby(df_unique['Insurance Provider'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)


```

Lipitor was the drug most likely prescribed to someone with diabetes. A reason for this is that people with diabetes are twice as likely to have [heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/diabetes-complications/diabetes-and-your-heart.html) or a stroke compared to people without diabetes. Medications such as Lipitor are effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering the chances of a stroke. However, penicilin was the the medication that was billed the most.

```{python}
medication = diabetes['Medication'].value_counts()
print(medication)

plt.bar(medication.index, medication.values)
plt.xlabel('Medication')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Frequency of Medications')
plt.show()



```

```{python}
costmed = df.groupby(diabetes['Medication'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)


newdf = diabetes[['Medication', 'Insurance Provider', 'Billing Amount']]

medication_billing = newdf.groupby(['Insurance Provider', 'Medication'])['Billing Amount'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(8).reset_index()
print(medication_billing)

```
